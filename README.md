# ðŸ”‘ Core DSA Patterns

This document lists all the **core DSA patterns** you need to recognize during problem-solving.  
Each row explains **when to use** the pattern and gives **example problems**.

## âœ… How to Use
- Start with easier patterns (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Prefix Sum).  
- Move towards intermediate ones (DP, Graphs, Monotonic Stack).  
- Finally, tackle advanced ones (Segment Trees, SCC, Flow).  
- After solving a problem, **mark which pattern it belongs to**.
